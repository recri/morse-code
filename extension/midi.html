      <p>MIDI input requires support in Chrome that isn't there as of April 1, 2015.  The support
      appears to be targetted for Release 43.  My Chromebook is running release 41 on the stable channel.</p>
      <p>To get what little support exists you need to open chrome://flags and enable the flag associated
      with "Enable Web MIDI Api".  That will, after a restart, allow the navigator.requestMIDIAccess()
      method to be called, but you won't be able to connect to any of the MIDI devices discovered.</p>
